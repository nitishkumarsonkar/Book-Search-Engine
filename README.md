# Book Search Engine

## Overview
This project is a **Book Search Engine** built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. It allows users to search for books based on different criteria. The project uses **PostgreSQL** as the database and is containerized using **Docker**. The build process is managed with **Maven**.

## Features
- Search for books by title, author, or genre.
- PostgreSQL database setup using Docker.
- RESTful API endpoints built with Spring Boot.
- Maven-based build system for project dependencies and management.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Spring Boot framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (Dockerized setup)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Maven** (build automation)

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Setup and Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-search-engine.git
cd book-search-engine
